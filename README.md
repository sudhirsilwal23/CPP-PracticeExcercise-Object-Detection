# C++ Lambda Exercises for Object Detection

This repository contains **advanced C++ lambda function exercises** applied to object detection tasks (e.g., bounding boxes, confidence scores, IOU calculations). The exercises are organized into sections: **Basic Lambdas, Lambdas with Parameters, Passing to Functions, Loops, Capture Clauses, and Comparisons with Regular Functions.**

---

## 1. Basic Lambda Examples
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Write a lambda to count all detected objects with a confidence score above a user-defined threshold.  
- **Class Filtering**: Use a lambda to count how many objects of a specific class (e.g., 'car') were detected.  
- **Area Check**: Create a lambda to check if any detected object's bounding box area is smaller than 100 pixels.  
- **Empty Detections**: Write a lambda to check if the vector of detections is empty.  
- **Score Averaging**: Use a lambda with `std::accumulate` to calculate the average confidence score of all detected objects.

## 2. Lambda with Parameters
- **Detailed Object Info**: Write a lambda that takes a `DetectedObject` as a parameter and prints its ID, class, and confidence score.  
- **Confidence Normalization**: Create a lambda that takes a `DetectedObject` by reference and normalizes its confidence score to a range between 0 and 1.  
- **IOU Calculation**: Write a lambda that takes two `DetectedObjects` and calculates their Intersection over Union (IOU).  
- **Scaling Bounding Boxes**: Use a lambda that takes a `DetectedObject` and a scaling factor to resize its bounding box dimensions.  
- **Distance from Center**: Create a lambda that takes a `DetectedObject` and calculates the Euclidean distance of its bounding box center from the image center.

## 3. Passing Lambdas to Functions
- **Custom Sorting**: Create a `sort_detections` function that takes a vector of `DetectedObjects` and a custom comparison lambda. Use it to sort the objects by confidence, from highest to lowest.  
- **Generic Filtering**: Write a `filter_detections` function that takes a vector of `DetectedObjects` and a boolean-returning lambda. Use it to filter out objects based on a dynamic condition (e.g., filtering by class or size).  
- **Applying Transformations**: Develop an `apply_to_detections` function that takes a vector and a void-returning lambda. Use this to apply a transformation like printing, logging, or drawing to each object.  
- **Finding Best Match**: Implement a `find_best_match` function that takes a target object and a lambda. The lambda should define the "match" criteria (e.g., lowest distance, highest IOU), and the function should return the best match from a list of candidates.  
- **Batch Processing**: Write a `process_batch` function that takes a subset of detections and a lambda. Use the lambda to perform a specific task on the subset, like calculating the mean confidence for that batch.

## 4. Using Lambdas in Loops
- **Per-Object Logging**: Use a range-based for loop and a lambda to log the details of each detected object, including its class, ID, and confidence, for a specific frame.  
- **Conditional Drawing**: Iterate through a list of detections. Use a lambda inside the loop to draw a bounding box only for objects whose confidence is above a certain threshold.  
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: In a loop, use a lambda to apply a different confidence threshold to different classes of objects (e.g., car detections need higher confidence than person detections).  
- **Bounding Box Intersection**: Inside a nested loop (for each pair of detections), use a lambda to check if their bounding boxes intersect and print their IDs if they do.  
- **Counting by Class**: Iterate through the detections and use a lambda to increment a counter for each class, effectively tallying the number of objects per class.

## 5. Capture Clause [] and Capture by Reference
- **Bounding Box Coordinates**: Use a lambda with a capture to check if a bounding box's coordinates are within the image dimensions, which are captured from the outer scope.  
- **Global Counter**: Capture a counter variable by reference (`[&]`) to count the total number of processed objects across multiple processing steps.  
- **Image Modification**: Use a lambda with a reference capture to modify an image matrix (e.g., a `cv::Mat`) by drawing a bounding box on it for each detected object.  
- **Confidence Threshold**: Capture a user-defined confidence threshold value by reference to create a filter lambda. The filter can be dynamically updated by changing the captured variable's value.  
- **Log File Handle**: Capture a reference to an open file stream to write logging information about each detection to a single file.

## 6. Regular Functions vs. Lambda Functions
- **Reusability**: Write a reusable `calculate_iou` regular function. Then, write a one-off lambda to calculate the IOU for a specific pair of overlapping detections in a single-frame analysis.  
- **Custom Sorting**: Create a named function `compare_by_confidence` to sort detections. Then, create an equivalent lambda and use `std::sort` with it to achieve the same result. Discuss the benefits of each approach.  
- **Simple vs. Complex Logic**: Write a simple `print_object_info` regular function. Then, create a lambda to do the same but with an added, in-line check for confidence to decide whether to print or not, demonstrating the concise, specific use of lambdas.  
- **Performance**: Write both a regular function and a lambda to perform a simple bounding box area calculation. Measure their performance to highlight that for such simple tasks, there is often negligible performance difference.  
- **Callback Use Case**: Design a mock `run_inference` function that accepts a function pointer or `std::function` as a callback for post-processing. Show how a named function can be passed as the callback, and then show how a lambda can be used instead for more concise, context-specific post-processing.
