#  C++ Exercises for Object Detection Concepts

This repository contains multiple sets of **C++ exercises** designed to strengthen programming skills in the context of **object detection**  metrics and components.  
Each set covers different aspects of the C++ language from function parameter passing to STL containers and lambda functions ‚Äî all applied to bounding boxes, image segmentation, and object tracking components.

---

## Prerequisites

- **C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (g++, clang++, MSVC).** 
- **Basic knowledge of C++ syntax.** 
- **Familiarity with object detection terminology (Bounding boxes, IoU, mAP, Detections, Confidence score, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AP@50, AP@7).**

Sections include:
* [Sequential Containers (Vector, List, Array)](STL/1.%20Sequential%20Containers%20(Vector,%20List,%20Array)) ‚Üí bounding box storage, `std::list`, `std::vector`.
* [Associative Containers (Map, Set)](STL/2.%20Associative%20Containers%20(Map,%20Set)) ‚Üí counting objects, unique IDs, mapping IDs to properties.
* [Container Adapters (Queue, Stack, Deque)](STL/3.%20Container%20Adapters%20(Queue,%20Stack,%20Deque)) ‚Üí FIFO detection processing, undo/redo stacks, priority dequeues.
* [C++ Algorithms with Lambda Functions](STL/4.%20STL%20Lambda%20and%20Standard%20Algorithms) ‚Üí using `accumulate`, `copy`, `count`, `find`, `replace`, `reverse`, and `sort` with detection data.

## How to Compile and Run

Each exercise is a standalone `.cpp` file. You can compile and run any file with `g++`:

```bash
# Compile
g++ Exercise1.cpp -o Exercise1

# Run
./Exercise1
```

**Note:** For all the files compilation and execution steps are the same.  

Just replace the c++ source code filename(Exercise1.cpp) in the compile command with the file you want to run.
-o Exercise1: This is an option flag that tells the compiler to name the output executable file Exercise1. Running the Executable ./Exercise1.

## Future Plan

I will continue expanding this collection with additional C++ concepts. Planned topics for future include:

- **Object Detection, Tracking and Image Segmentation Simulation for a single class in C++.** 
- **CUTLASS for efficient GPU matrix-multiplication kernels in C++.**
- **Triton Inference Server concepts for deploying C++ inference pipelines.**
- **Templates for generic programming in object detection tasks.** 
- **Eigen C++ Template Library for advanced matrix and linear algebra operations.** 
- **Enums for managing object states and categories.** 

This is an ongoing process, and more exercises and code details will be added step by step in each file.**
