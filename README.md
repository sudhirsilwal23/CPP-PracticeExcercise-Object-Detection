# üéØ Object Detection C++ Exercises Collection

This repository contains multiple sets of **C++ exercises** designed to strengthen programming skills in the context of **object detection**.  
Each set covers different aspects of the C++ language ‚Äî from function parameter passing to STL containers and lambda functions ‚Äî all applied to bounding boxes, image segmentation, and object tracking tasks.

## üîß Future Plan

I will continue expanding this collection with additional C++ concepts. Planned topics for future include:

- **Object Detection, Tracking and Image Segmentation Simulation for a single class in C++.** 
- **CUTLASS for efficient GPU matrix-multiplication kernels in C++.**
- **Triton Inference Server concepts for deploying C++ inference pipelines.**
- **Templates for generic programming in object detection tasks.** 
- **Eigen C++ Template Library for advanced matrix and linear algebra operations.** 
- **Enums for managing object states and categories.** 

This is an ongoing process, and more exercises and code details will be added step by step in each file.**

## üîß Prerequisites

- **C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (g++, clang++, MSVC).** 
- **Basic knowledge of C++ syntax.** 
- **Familiarity with object detection terminology (Bounding boxes, IoU, mAP, Detections, Confidence score, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AP@50, AP@7).**

### 4. C++ STL Containers
This folder contains **35 STL container and algorithm exercises** integrated with object detection tasks.  

Sections include:
* [Sequential Containers](STL/Sequential%20Containers) ‚Üí bounding box storage, tracking with `std::list`, resizing with `std::vector`.
* [Associative Containers](STL/Associative%20Containers) ‚Üí counting objects, unique IDs, mapping IDs to properties.
* [Container Adapters](STL/Container%20Adapters) ‚Üí FIFO detection processing, undo/redo stacks, priority dequeues.
* [C++ Algorithms with Lambda Functions](STL/Algorithms%20with%20Lambda%20Functions) ‚Üí using `accumulate`, `copy`, `count`, `find`, `replace`, `reverse`, and `sort` with detection data.

## ‚ö° How to Compile and Run

Each exercise is a standalone `.cpp` file. You can compile and run any file with `g++`:

```bash
# Compile
g++ Exercise1.cpp -o Exercise1

# Run
./Exercise1
```

**Note:** For all the files compilation and execution steps are the same.  

		  Just replace the filename in the compile command with the file you want to run.
