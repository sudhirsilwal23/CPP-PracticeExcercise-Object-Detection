# âš¡ C++ Capture Clause [] and Capture by Reference[&] Exercises 

---

- **Exercise 21. Bounding Box Coordinates**  
  Use a lambda with a capture to check if a bounding box's coordinates are within the image dimensions, which are captured from the outer scope.  

- **Exercise 22. Global Counter**  
  Capture a counter variable by reference (`[&]`) to count the total number of processed objects across multiple processing steps.  

- **Exercise 23. Image Modification**  
  Use a lambda with a reference capture to modify an image matrix (e.g., a `cv::Mat`) by drawing a bounding box on it for each detected object.  

- **Exercise 24. Confidence Threshold**  
  Capture a user-defined confidence threshold value by reference to create a filter lambda.  
  The filter can be dynamically updated by changing the captured variable's value.  

- **Exercise 25. Log File Handle**  
  Capture a reference to an open file stream to write logging information about each detection to a single file.
