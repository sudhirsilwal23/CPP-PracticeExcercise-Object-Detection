# ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection C++ Exercises Collection

This repository contains multiple sets of **C++ exercises** designed to strengthen programming skills in the context of **object detection**.  
Each set covers different aspects of the C++ language â€” from parameter passing to STL containers and lambda functions â€” all applied to bounding boxes, detections, and tracking tasks.

## ðŸ”§ Future Plan

I will continue expanding this collection with additional C++ concepts. Planned topics for future include:

- **Object Detection, Tracking and Image Segmentation Simulation for a single class in C++.** 
- **ONNX Runtime (ORT) Concepts for inference integration.**
- **CUTLASS for efficient GPU matrix-multiplication kernels in C++.**
- **Triton Inference Server concepts for deploying C++ inference pipelines.**
- **Templates for generic programming in object detection tasks.** 
- **Eigen C++ Template Library for advanced matrix and linear algebra operations.** 
- **Enums for managing object states and categories.** 

This is an ongoing process, and more exercises and code details will be added step by step in each file.**

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- **C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (g++, clang++, MSVC).** 
- **Basic knowledge of C++ syntax.** 
- **Familiarity with object detection terminology (bounding boxes, detections, confidence score).**

## ðŸ“‚ Exercise Sets in 4 Folders

### 1. C++ Function Parameters and Argument Passing 
This folder contains **20 C++ exercises** for learning object detectionâ€“related programming concepts using:  

Sections include:
- **Call by Value**  
- **Call by Reference**  
- **Call by Pointer**  
- **Call by const Reference**

### 2. C++ Lambda 
This folder contains **30 lambda function exercises** applied to object detection tasks (e.g., bounding boxes, confidence scores, IOU calculations).  

Sections include:
- **Basic Lambdas** â†’ thresholding, filtering, area checks.  
- **Lambdas with Parameters** â†’ IOU, scaling, normalization.  
- **Passing Lambdas to Functions** â†’ sorting, filtering, transformations.  
- **Lambdas in Loops** â†’ logging, drawing, dynamic thresholds.  
- **Capture Clauses** â†’ modifying counters, thresholds, and logging.  
- **Comparisons with Regular Functions** â†’ reusability, performance, callbacks.

### 3. C++ Pointer 
This folder contains **15 pointer-based C++ exercises** to build intuition on pointer usage in detection pipelines.

Sections include:
- **Creating Pointers** â†’ pointing to detections and bounding boxes.  
- **Dereferencing Pointers** â†’ accessing and printing object data.  
- **Modifying Pointer Values** â†’ updating confidence, resizing boxes, swapping objects.  

---

### 4. C++ STL Containers
This folder contains **35 STL container and algorithm exercises** integrated with object detection tasks.  

Sections include:
- **Sequential Containers (Vector, List, Array)** â†’ bounding box storage, tracking with `std::list`, resizing with `std::vector`.  
- **Associative Containers (Map, Set)** â†’ counting objects, unique IDs, mapping IDs to properties.  
- **Container Adapters (Queue, Stack, Deque)** â†’ FIFO detection processing, undo/redo stacks, priority dequeues.  
- **C++ Algorithms with Lambda Functions** â†’ using `accumulate`, `copy`, `count`, `find`, `replace`, `reverse`, and `sort` with detection data.

## âš¡ How to Compile and Run

Each exercise is a standalone `.cpp` file. You can compile and run any file with `g++`:

```bash
# Compile
g++ Exercise1.cpp -o Exercise1

# Run
./Exercise1
